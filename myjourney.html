            I was first introduced to coding in high school with some basic html. Later on in life i would pick up html again but with more
            tools to manipulate functionality. Once i got an idea of Javascript and Css it was gameover. I started to create websites and would
            furter improve my skills by completing certs from two well known coding orgs, freeCodeCamp and Codecademy. Im currently working on finishing
            my courses in order to recieve my certificates.
